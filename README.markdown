TODO
====

* Rethink Alternative-File Command to avoid encouraging "feature coupled steps.":http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/feature-coupled-steps-antipattern
* Navigation Commands
* From a step definition be able to pull up a list of features using that step and to jump to them.
* Automatically create template step file with pending steps based on the steps used in the feature.
* Use Cucumber's built in functionality to do this and clean out the story bundle's way.
* Snippets for tables.
* Multi-language support for the snippets?
