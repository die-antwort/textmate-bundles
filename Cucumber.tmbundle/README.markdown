    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    git clone git://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-tmbundle.git Cucumber.tmbundle
    osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'

To install the color themes for the syntax highlighting, install the as follows:

    open color_themes/Cobalt.tmTheme

Adaptations of other themes is welcome!

If you are using [RVM](http://beginrescueend.com/) you can set up TextMate to use your RVM settings (read your `.rvmrc` file) by following [these instructions](http://beginrescueend.com/integration/textmate/).

TODO
====

* Rethink Alternative-File Command to avoid encouraging "feature coupled steps.":http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/feature-coupled-steps-antipattern
* Navigation Commands
* From a step definition be able to pull up a list of features using that step and to jump to them.
* Automatically create template step file with pending steps based on the steps used in the feature.
* Use Cucumber's built in functionality to do this and clean out the story bundle's way.
* Snippets for tables.
* Multi-language support for the snippets?
